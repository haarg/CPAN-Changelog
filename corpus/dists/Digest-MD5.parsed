Source\n   builds on Windows was apparently broken.\n\n\n\n2003-07-21   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.26\n\n   Don't assume PerlIO_read() works like fread() even though\n   it was documented like that for perl 5.6.  It returns negative\n   on read failure.\n\n   Kill test #3 in t/badfile.t.  I don't know a reliable way\n   to test read failures on a file handle.  Seems better not to\n   test than to make many worry.\n\n\n\n2003-07-04   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.25\n\n   The \$md5->addfile method now croaks if it discovers\n   errors on the handle after reading from it.  This should\n   make it more difficult to end up with the wrong digest\n   just because you are to lazy to check the error status\n   on your file handles after reading from them.\n\n   Improved documentation.\n\n   Sync up with bleadperl; even safer patchlevel include.\n\n\n\n2003-03-09   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.24\n\n   Don't let the \$^W test get confused by lexical warnings.\n\n   Sync up with bleadperl; safer patchlevel include.\n\n\n\n2003-01-18   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.23\n\n   Override INSTALLDIRS for 5.8 as suggested by\n   Guido Ostkamp <Guido.Ostkamp\@t-online.de>.\n\n\n\n2003-01-04   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.22.\n\n   Added clone method.\n   Contributed by Holger Smolinski <holger\@kunterbunt.bb.bawue.de>\n\n\n\n2002-12-27   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.21\n\n   Minor tweaks sync up with bleadperl:\n     - VMS optimizer tweaks to the Makefile.PL\n     - MacOS support\n     - Added alignment test\n\n   Added example to the MD5 POD that shows how to calculate the\n   digest of Unicode strings.\n\n\n\n2002-05-05   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.20\n\n   More synchronization with tweaks Jarkko have done to the\n   bleadperl test suite. This time various EBCDIC hacks.\n\n   Outside PERL_CORE the md5-aaa.t test loaded the wrong version of\n   the module (and would fail if no previous Digest::MD5 was installed).\n   Patch by Mike Stok <mike\@stok.co.uk>\n\n\n\n2002-05-01   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.19\n\n   One more test suite update from Jarkko to sync it\n   even better with bleadperl.\n\n\n\n2002-05-01   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.18\n\n   Changes #12954 and #16173 from bleadperl.  Documentation typo fix\n   and some signed/unsigned mismatches that Microsoft's C compiler\n   complained about.\n\n   The EBCDIC-aware md5-aaa.t from bleadperl.\n\n\n\n2002-04-25   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.17\n\n   The SvPVbyte in perl-5.6.1 is buggy.  Use the one from 5.7.3\n   instead.\n\n   Give warning if the function interface is used as instance\n   methods:  \$md5->md5_hex().\n\n\n\n2001-09-07   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.16\n\n   Sync up with the bleadperl version:\n      - use SvPVbyte() if available\n      - fixes to make the code 'gcc -Wall'-clean\n\n\n\n2001-08-27   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.15\n\n   Avoid exit() in Makefile.PL and bleadperl redefinition of printf\n   in the alignment test program.\n   Patch by Doug MacEachern <dougm\@covalent.net>.\n\n\n\n2001-07-18   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.14\n\n   Try to warn if the functional interface is used as methods,\n   i.e. Digest::MD5->md5_hex(\"foo\") will make noise if -w is\n   enabled.\n\n   Document the missing padding for the base64 digests.\n\n   If both XS bootstrap and locating Digest::Perl::MD5 fails\n   re-raise the original XS bootstrap exception.\n\n\n\n2001-03-13   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.13\n\n   Moved all other Digest:: modules out of the Digest-MD5 dist.\n\n\n\n2000-09-18   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.12\n\n   Avoid pointer cast warning for machines with bigger ints\n   than pointers.  Patch by Robin Barker <rmb1\@cise.npl.co.uk>.\n\n\n\n2000-08-19   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.11\n   \n   The fallback code introduced in 2.10 did only work for\n   perl-5.6.0.  It should now for for perl5.004 and 5.005\n   as well.  Patch by Ville Skytt\303\244 <ville\@office.popsystems.com>.\n\n\n\n2000-08-18   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.10\n\n   Digest::MD5 will now try to fallback to the pure perl\n   implementation of Digest::Perl::MD5 if bootstrap fails.\n\n   Added a bit internal paranoia about casting the IV\n   in the Digest::MD5 object to the MD5_CTX* pointer.\n\n\n\n1999-08-06   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.09\n\n   Documentation update.\n\n\n\n1999-07-28   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.08\n\n   The addfile() methods could trigger a core dump when passed\n   a filehandle that had failed to open.\n\n\n\n1999-04-26   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.07\n\n   The Digest::SHA1 module failed on some 64-bit systems, because I\n   assumed there was a correspondence between the U32 size and\n   BYTEORDER.  This version use 'unsigned long' as Uwe's original\n   SHA module did.\n\n   The module should now work better when liked statically with perl,\n   because we now use a safer module-loaded test in Digest.pm.\n\n   Assume we know the outcome of the alignment test on VMS. Patch by\n   Chuck Lane <lane\@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu>\n\n\n\n1999-03-26   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.06\n\n   Avoid LONG and BYTE types in SHA.xs as they was in conflict\n   with similar definitions in <winnt.h>.\n\n   Patch by Marko Asplund <aspa\@hip.fi> to make the alignment\n   test program link successfully with sfio-perl.\n\n   Fixed a typo in MD5.xs that might have affected 64-bit systems.\n   Spotted by Nick Ing-Simmons\n\n\n\n1999-03-15   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.05\n\n   Included Digest::SHA1 based on Uwe Hollerbach's SHA module.\n\n\n\n1999-03-05   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.04\n\n   Avoid the -o option when compiling alignment test program\n   for Win32 as suggested by Gurusamy Sarathy.\n\n   DEC Compiler bug workaround.  Contributed by D Roland Walker\n   <walker\@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>\n\n   Having references to a local variable called \"na\" was not\n   very safe either.  Some older versions of Perl can apparently\n   macroize this into something completely different.\n\n\n\n1999-02-27   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.03\n\n   Patch from Christopher J. Madsen <chris_madsen\@geocities.com> that\n   should help getting the u32align test program to compile with\n   Visual C++ 5 on Windows NT.\n\n   Got rid of references to PL_na.\n\n\n\n1999-01-31   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.02\n\n   Added a hints file as workaround for an IRIX compiler bug.\n   Contributed by D Roland Walker <walker\@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>.\n\n   Note that the rfc2202 test can still fail on some DEC Alpha,\n   because of a compiler bug that affects the perl 'x' operator.\n   The Digest:: modules should work and be safe to install anyway.\n\n\n\n1998-12-18   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 2.01\n\n   Some casts and tweaks to make picky compilers more happy.\n\n\n\n1998-11-04   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 2.00.\n\n   Taken out Digest::SHA1 as this module will be provided from Uwe\n   Hollerbach later.\n\n   Some tweaks to MD2.xs and MD5.xs since \"na\" disappeared in\n   perl5.005_53\n\n\n\n1998-10-30   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_60\n\n   The 1.99_59 release introduced compilation problems for big-endian\n   systems with free U32 alignment.  Bug reported, and fix suggested\n   by Paul J. Schinder <schinder\@pobox.com>.\n\n\n\n1998-10-28   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_59\n\n   Makefile.PL will run a test program to find out if U32 values can\n   be aligned anywhere.  This hopefully cures the core dumps reported\n   on Solaris and other big endian systems.  Thanks to Graham Barr for\n   debugging this.\n\n\n\n1998-10-28   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_58\n\n   Should be very close to a 2.00 release now.  Need some success\n   reports from people running on big-endian machines first I think.\n\n   Added a Digest::MD2 implementation.\n\n   Wrote Digest.pm documentation.  This define the interface that all\n   Digest:: modules should provide.\n\n   Avoided some code duplication in MD5.xs\n\n   Fixed typo, that prevented Digest::SHA1::sha1_base64() from working.\n\n\n\n1998-10-27   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_57\n\n   Rewritten most of the MD5 C code to make it real fast (especially\n   on little-endian machines without alignment restrictions for U32).\n   Compared to MD5-1.7 we can process files 4 times as fast and we\n   digest small stuff in memory 7 times faster.  I came to these\n   conclusions after these tests (gcc -O2, i586, Linux):\n\n   First tested calculation of the digest of a 31 MB file, using\n   perl -le 'print Digest::MD5->new->addfile(*STDIN)->hexdigest'\n   and similar stuff:\n\n      MD5-1.7:                 21.06s\n      Digest::MD5-1.99_57:      5.23s\n      md5sum (GNU textutils):   4.90s\n\n   As you can see, we do nearly as good as the md5sum program.  I\n   think the reason we don't beat md5sum is that perl always insist on\n   loading extra modules like Config.pm, Carp.pm, strict.pm, vars.pm,\n   AutoLoader.pm and DynaLoader.pm.  When I simply wrapped the MD5.xs\n   hasher code in a C program I managed to process the file in 4.68s.\n\n   Then we calculated the digest of the same 6 byte sting, 20000\n   times:\n\n      MD5-1.7:                 11.81s\n      Digest::MD5-1.99_57:      1.68s\n\n   Digest::MD5 benefit from making this into a plain procedure call\n   instead of a static method call.\n\n\n   Other changes in this release are:\n\n   Documentation update\n\n   Internal MD5.xs cleanup.\n\n   \$md5->digest will automatically reset now.\n\n   Digest::HMAC methods add() and addfile() did not return the\n   correct object.\n\n   Added Digest.pm loading module.  I am not sure this is a good idea.\n\n   Added Digest::SHA1 and Digest::HMAC_SHA1 module.  The Digest::SHA1\n   module is just a wrapper around SHA.pm.  I hope to get the author\n   of SHA.pm to move his module to the Digest:: category.\n\n\n\n1998-10-25   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_56\n\n   Fix memcpy_byteswap() function in MD5.xs.  Must be careful with\n   htovl() as it might evaluate its arguments more than once.\n\n\n\n1998-10-25   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_55\n\n   Grahams HMAC_MD5.pm split into two modules.  Digest::HMAC and\n   Digest::HMAC_MD5.  Also provide functional interface.  Documentation\n   is still lacking.\n\n   Included RFC 2202 based test for HMAC-MD5.\n\n\n\n1998-10-24   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_54\n\n   Included HMAC_MD5.pm, contributed by Graham Barr <gbarr\@ti.com>.\n\n   I have a hard time to make up my mind :-)  md5_bin() renamed back\n   to md5().   Functions are not exported by default any more.\n\n   Try to Encode/Decode with memcpy_byteswap for 32-bit big-endian\n   machines.\n\n\n\n1998-10-23   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_53\n\n   Renamed core module as Digest::MD5.  Leave a MD5.pm stub for\n   legacy code.\n\n   The md5() function renamed as md5_bin().\n\n   The constructor, Digest::MD5->new, no longer takes any extra\n   arguments.\n\n   Added some new tests.\n\n   Updated the documentation.\n\n   \$md5->b64digest implemented with same base64 encoder as md5_base64.\n\n\n\n1998-10-23   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_52\n\n   Patch from Graham Barr which make it work for big-endian machines\n   again.\n\n\n\n1998-10-22   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_51\n\n   The MD5 class is now subclassable.\n\n   The add() and addfile() methods now return \$self.\n\n   The reset() method is just an alias for new().\n\n   The constructor (MD5->new) now takes optional arguments which are\n   automatically added.  It means that we can now write:\n\n      MD5->new(\$data)->hexdigest;\n\n   New \$md5->b64digest method.\n\n   New functions that are exported on request: md5, md5_hex, md5_base64\n\n   Included RFC 1321\n\n   Barely started to update the documentation.\n\n\n\n1998-10-22   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_50\n\n   Much better performance (more than twice as fast now).  Mostly\n   because we use Copy/Zero instead of the original MD5_memcpy and\n   MD5_memset functions.\n\n   The addfile() and hexdigest() methods are now XS implemented.\n\n   All RSA functions now included in MD5.xs and made static.\n\n   Use perl's Copy/Zero.\n\n   Random cleanup, simplifications and reformatting.\n   Merged things better with the perl configuration.\n\n\n\nNeil Winton's versions below:\n\n\n*** 96/06/20 Version 1.7\n\nMD5 is now completely 64-bit clean (I hope). The basic MD5 code uses\n32-bit quantities and requires a typedef UINT4 to be defined in\nglobal.h. Perl configuration data (the value of BYTEORDER) is used to\ndetermine if unsigned longs have 4 or 8 bytes. On 64-bit platforms (eg\nDEC Alpha) then it assumes that \"unsigned int\" will be a 32-bit type.\nIf this is incorrect then adding -DUINT4_IS_LONG to the DEFINES line in\nMakefile.PL will override this.\n\nOn some machines (at least Cray that I know of) there is no 32-bit\ninteger type. In this case defining TRUNCATE_UINT4 (which is done\nautomatically for a Cray) will ensure that 64-bit values are masked\ndown to 32 bits. I have done my best to test this but without easy\naccess to a true 64-bit machine I can not totally guarantee it (unless\nanyone wants to lend me a spare Cray :-)\n\nThere is one remaining limitation for 64-bit enabled processors. The\namount of data passed to any single call to the underlying MD5\nroutines is limited to (2^32 - 1) bytes -- that's 4 gigabytes. I'm\nsorry if that's a real problem for you ...\n\nAnd finally, a minor compilation warning (unsigned char * used with\nfunction having char * prototype) has also been eliminated.\n\n*** 96/04/09 Version 1.6\n\nRe-generated module framework using h2xs to pick up the latest module\nconventions for versions etc. You can now say \"use MD5 1.6;\" and things\nshould work correctly. MD5.pod has been integrated into MD5.pm and\nCHANGES renamed to Changes. There is a fairly comprehensive test.pl\nwhich can be invoked via \"make test\". There are no functional changes\nto the MD5 routines themselves.\n\n*** 96/03/14 Version 1.5.3\n\nFixed addfile method to accept type-glob references for the file-handle\n(eg \\*STDOUT). This is more consistent with other routines and is now the\nrecommended way of passing file-handles. The documentation now gives more\nexamples as to how the routines might be used.\n\n*** 96/03/12 Version 1.5.2\n\nMinor fixes from Christopher J Madsen <madsen\@computek.net> to provide\nsupport for building on OS/2 (and to work around a perl -w bug).\n\nRemove warning about possible difference between add('foo', 'bar') and\nadd('foobar'). This is not true (it may have been true in the earliest\nversion of the module but is no longer the case).\n\n*** 96/03/08 Version 1.5.1\n\nAdd CHANGES file to make it easier for people to figure out what has\nbeen going on. (Meant to do this as part of 1.5)\n\n*** 96/03/05 Version 1.5\n\nAdd hash() and hexhash() methods at the suggestion/request of Gary\nHowland <gary\@kampai.euronet.nl> before inclusion in a wider library\nof cryptography modules.\n\n*** 96/02/27 Version 1.4\n\nFinally fixed the pesky Solaris dynamic loading bug.

Patch by Robin Barker <rmb1\@cise.npl.co.uk>.\n\n\n\n2000-08-19   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.11\n   \n   The fallback code introduced in 2.10 did only work for\n   perl-5.6.0.  It should now for for perl5.004 and 5.005\n   as well.  Patch by Ville Skytt\303\244 <ville\@office.popsystems.com>.\n\n\n\n2000-08-18   Gisle Aas <gisle\@ActiveState.com>\n\n   Release 2.10\n\n   Digest::MD5 will now try to fallback to the pure perl\n   implementation of Digest::Perl::MD5 if bootstrap fails.\n\n   Added a bit internal paranoia about casting the IV\n   in the Digest::MD5 object to the MD5_CTX* pointer.\n\n\n\n1999-08-06   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.09\n\n   Documentation update.\n\n\n\n1999-07-28   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.08\n\n   The addfile() methods could trigger a core dump when passed\n   a filehandle that had failed to open.\n\n\n\n1999-04-26   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.07\n\n   The Digest::SHA1 module failed on some 64-bit systems, because I\n   assumed there was a correspondence between the U32 size and\n   BYTEORDER.  This version use 'unsigned long' as Uwe's original\n   SHA module did.\n\n   The module should now work better when liked statically with perl,\n   because we now use a safer module-loaded test in Digest.pm.\n\n   Assume we know the outcome of the alignment test on VMS. Patch by\n   Chuck Lane <lane\@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu>\n\n\n\n1999-03-26   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.06\n\n   Avoid LONG and BYTE types in SHA.xs as they was in conflict\n   with similar definitions in <winnt.h>.\n\n   Patch by Marko Asplund <aspa\@hip.fi> to make the alignment\n   test program link successfully with sfio-perl.\n\n   Fixed a typo in MD5.xs that might have affected 64-bit systems.\n   Spotted by Nick Ing-Simmons\n\n\n\n1999-03-15   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.05\n\n   Included Digest::SHA1 based on Uwe Hollerbach's SHA module.\n\n\n\n1999-03-05   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.04\n\n   Avoid the -o option when compiling alignment test program\n   for Win32 as suggested by Gurusamy Sarathy.\n\n   DEC Compiler bug workaround.  Contributed by D Roland Walker\n   <walker\@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>\n\n   Having references to a local variable called \"na\" was not\n   very safe either.  Some older versions of Perl can apparently\n   macroize this into something completely different.\n\n\n\n1999-02-27   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.03\n\n   Patch from Christopher J. Madsen <chris_madsen\@geocities.com> that\n   should help getting the u32align test program to compile with\n   Visual C++ 5 on Windows NT.\n\n   Got rid of references to PL_na.\n\n\n\n1999-01-31   Gisle Aas <gisle\@aas.no>\n\n   Release 2.02\n\n   Added a hints file as workaround for an IRIX compiler bug.\n   Contributed by D Roland Walker <walker\@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>.\n\n   Note that the rfc2202 test can still fail on some DEC Alpha,\n   because of a compiler bug that affects the perl 'x' operator.\n   The Digest:: modules should work and be safe to install anyway.\n\n\n\n1998-12-18   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 2.01\n\n   Some casts and tweaks to make picky compilers more happy.\n\n\n\n1998-11-04   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 2.00.\n\n   Taken out Digest::SHA1 as this module will be provided from Uwe\n   Hollerbach later.\n\n   Some tweaks to MD2.xs and MD5.xs since \"na\" disappeared in\n   perl5.005_53\n\n\n\n1998-10-30   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_60\n\n   The 1.99_59 release introduced compilation problems for big-endian\n   systems with free U32 alignment.  Bug reported, and fix suggested\n   by Paul J. Schinder <schinder\@pobox.com>.\n\n\n\n1998-10-28   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_59\n\n   Makefile.PL will run a test program to find out if U32 values can\n   be aligned anywhere.  This hopefully cures the core dumps reported\n   on Solaris and other big endian systems.  Thanks to Graham Barr for\n   debugging this.\n\n\n\n1998-10-28   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_58\n\n   Should be very close to a 2.00 release now.  Need some success\n   reports from people running on big-endian machines first I think.\n\n   Added a Digest::MD2 implementation.\n\n   Wrote Digest.pm documentation.  This define the interface that all\n   Digest:: modules should provide.\n\n   Avoided some code duplication in MD5.xs\n\n   Fixed typo, that prevented Digest::SHA1::sha1_base64() from working.\n\n\n\n1998-10-27   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_57\n\n   Rewritten most of the MD5 C code to make it real fast (especially\n   on little-endian machines without alignment restrictions for U32).\n   Compared to MD5-1.7 we can process files 4 times as fast and we\n   digest small stuff in memory 7 times faster.  I came to these\n   conclusions after these tests (gcc -O2, i586, Linux):\n\n   First tested calculation of the digest of a 31 MB file, using\n   perl -le 'print Digest::MD5->new->addfile(*STDIN)->hexdigest'\n   and similar stuff:\n\n      MD5-1.7:                 21.06s\n      Digest::MD5-1.99_57:      5.23s\n      md5sum (GNU textutils):   4.90s\n\n   As you can see, we do nearly as good as the md5sum program.  I\n   think the reason we don't beat md5sum is that perl always insist on\n   loading extra modules like Config.pm, Carp.pm, strict.pm, vars.pm,\n   AutoLoader.pm and DynaLoader.pm.  When I simply wrapped the MD5.xs\n   hasher code in a C program I managed to process the file in 4.68s.\n\n   Then we calculated the digest of the same 6 byte sting, 20000\n   times:\n\n      MD5-1.7:                 11.81s\n      Digest::MD5-1.99_57:      1.68s\n\n   Digest::MD5 benefit from making this into a plain procedure call\n   instead of a static method call.\n\n\n   Other changes in this release are:\n\n   Documentation update\n\n   Internal MD5.xs cleanup.\n\n   \$md5->digest will automatically reset now.\n\n   Digest::HMAC methods add() and addfile() did not return the\n   correct object.\n\n   Added Digest.pm loading module.  I am not sure this is a good idea.\n\n   Added Digest::SHA1 and Digest::HMAC_SHA1 module.  The Digest::SHA1\n   module is just a wrapper around SHA.pm.  I hope to get the author\n   of SHA.pm to move his module to the Digest:: category.\n\n\n\n1998-10-25   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_56\n\n   Fix memcpy_byteswap() function in MD5.xs.  Must be careful with\n   htovl() as it might evaluate its arguments more than once.\n\n\n\n1998-10-25   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_55\n\n   Grahams HMAC_MD5.pm split into two modules.  Digest::HMAC and\n   Digest::HMAC_MD5.  Also provide functional interface.  Documentation\n   is still lacking.\n\n   Included RFC 2202 based test for HMAC-MD5.\n\n\n\n1998-10-24   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_54\n\n   Included HMAC_MD5.pm, contributed by Graham Barr <gbarr\@ti.com>.\n\n   I have a hard time to make up my mind :-)  md5_bin() renamed back\n   to md5().   Functions are not exported by default any more.\n\n   Try to Encode/Decode with memcpy_byteswap for 32-bit big-endian\n   machines.\n\n\n\n1998-10-23   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_53\n\n   Renamed core module as Digest::MD5.  Leave a MD5.pm stub for\n   legacy code.\n\n   The md5() function renamed as md5_bin().\n\n   The constructor, Digest::MD5->new, no longer takes any extra\n   arguments.\n\n   Added some new tests.\n\n   Updated the documentation.\n\n   \$md5->b64digest implemented with same base64 encoder as md5_base64.\n\n\n\n1998-10-23   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_52\n\n   Patch from Graham Barr which make it work for big-endian machines\n   again.\n\n\n\n1998-10-22   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_51\n\n   The MD5 class is now subclassable.\n\n   The add() and addfile() methods now return \$self.\n\n   The reset() method is just an alias for new().\n\n   The constructor (MD5->new) now takes optional arguments which are\n   automatically added.  It means that we can now write:\n\n      MD5->new(\$data)->hexdigest;\n\n   New \$md5->b64digest method.\n\n   New functions that are exported on request: md5, md5_hex, md5_base64\n\n   Included RFC 1321\n\n   Barely started to update the documentation.\n\n\n\n1998-10-22   Gisle Aas <aas\@sn.no>\n\n   Release 1.99_50\n\n   Much better performance (more than twice as fast now).  Mostly\n   because we use Copy/Zero instead of the original MD5_memcpy and\n   MD5_memset functions.\n\n   The addfile() and hexdigest() methods are now XS implemented.\n\n   All RSA functions now included in MD5.xs and made static.\n\n   Use perl's Copy/Zero.\n\n   Random cleanup, simplifications and reformatting.\n   Merged things better with the perl configuration.\n\n\n\nNeil Winton's versions below:\n\n\n*** 96/06/20 Version 1.7\n\nMD5 is now completely 64-bit clean (I hope). The basic MD5 code uses\n32-bit quantities and requires a typedef UINT4 to be defined in\nglobal.h. Perl configuration data (the value of BYTEORDER) is used to\ndetermine if unsigned longs have 4 or 8 bytes. On 64-bit platforms (eg\nDEC Alpha) then it assumes that \"unsigned int\" will be a 32-bit type.\nIf this is incorrect then adding -DUINT4_IS_LONG to the DEFINES line in\nMakefile.PL will override this.\n\nOn some machines (at least Cray that I know of) there is no 32-bit\ninteger type. In this case defining TRUNCATE_UINT4 (which is done\nautomatically for a Cray) will ensure that 64-bit values are masked\ndown to 32 bits. I have done my best to test this but without easy\naccess to a true 64-bit machine I can not totally guarantee it (unless\nanyone wants to lend me a spare Cray :-)\n\nThere is one remaining limitation for 64-bit enabled processors. The\namount of data passed to any single call to the underlying MD5\nroutines is limited to (2^32 - 1) bytes -- that's 4 gigabytes. I'm\nsorry if that's a real problem for you ...\n\nAnd finally, a minor compilation warning (unsigned char * used with\nfunction having char * prototype) has also been eliminated.\n\n*** 96/04/09 Version 1.6\n\nRe-generated module framework using h2xs to pick up the latest module\nconventions for versions etc. You can now say \"use MD5 1.6;\" and things\nshould work correctly. MD5.pod has been integrated into MD5.pm and\nCHANGES renamed to Changes. There is a fairly comprehensive test.pl\nwhich can be invoked via \"make test\". There are no functional changes\nto the MD5 routines themselves.\n\n*** 96/03/14 Version 1.5.3\n\nFixed addfile method to accept type-glob references for the file-handle\n(eg \\*STDOUT). This is more consistent with other routines and is now the\nrecommended way of passing file-handles. The documentation now gives more\nexamples as to how the routines might be used.\n\n*** 96/03/12 Version 1.5.2\n\nMinor fixes from Christopher J Madsen <madsen\@computek.net> to provide\nsupport for building on OS/2 (and to work around a perl -w bug).\n\nRemove warning about possible difference between add('foo', 'bar') and\nadd('foobar'). This is not true (it may have been true in the earliest\nversion of the module but is no longer the case).\n\n*** 96/03/08 Version 1.5.1\n\nAdd CHANGES file to make it easier for people to figure out what has\nbeen going on. (Meant to do this as part of 1.5)\n\n*** 96/03/05 Version 1.5\n\nAdd hash() and hexhash() methods at the suggestion/request of Gary\nHowland <gary\@kampai.euronet.nl> before inclusion in a wider library\nof cryptography modules.\n\n*** 96/02/27 Version 1.4\n\nFinally fixed the pesky Solaris dynamic loading bug. All kudos to Ken\nPizzini <kenp\@spry.com>!\n\n*** 95/11/29 Version 1.3.1\n\nAdd explanations of current known problems.\n\n*** 95/06/02 Version 1.3\n\nFix problems with scope resolution in addfile() reported by\nJean-Claude Giese <Jean-Claude.Giese\@loria.fr>.
